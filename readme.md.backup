# Gym Occupancy Monitoring System with AI and IoT

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered gym occupancy monitoring system that tracks the number of people in various gym zones in real-time using HC-SR501 PIR sensors, edge devices, and AI models. The system will detect occupancy, recognize activities, and display data on a web dashboard. It also includes alerts for overcrowding and zone usage insights to optimize gym operations and enhance the member experience.
